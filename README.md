## üìò Project Description

**Intelligent Stock Management and Customer Insights** is an AI-driven, full-stack system designed to help supermarket chains manage stock levels, forecast sales, and understand customer sentiment in real-time ‚Äî all from a unified platform.

### üß† What It Does
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predicts future sales using the SARIMA model to optimize restocking and reduce waste.
- **Customer Review System**: Collects and classifies customer feedback using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model.
- **Outlet Dashboard**: Manages inventory, tracks low-stock items, and visualizes daily/weekly/monthly sales.
- **Head Office Dashboard**: Aggregates data from all outlets for centralized analytics like income by city, top-selling products, and payment methods.
- **POS System**: Handles daily billing, offline sales recording, and automatic sync with the outlet database.



### ‚öôÔ∏è Why These Technologies?
- **Node.js + Express.js** ‚Äì Fast, scalable backend for POS and dashboards.
- **Python + Machine Learning** ‚Äì Powerful for time series forecasting (SARIMA) and NLP (RoBERTa sentiment analysis).
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Reliable relational DB for managing structured inventory and sales data.
- **Google OAuth2 + BCrypt** ‚Äì Ensures secure user authentication and session handling.

### üöß Challenges Faced
- Handling non-stationary sales data with traditional models like Linear Regression and Random Forest, which led to the adoption of SARIMA for better accuracy.
- Training and integrating a sentiment analysis model that performs well across mixed, noisy customer feedback.
- Ensuring smooth sync between offline POS systems and centralized databases without data loss or duplication.
- Building dashboards that visualize complex sales data in a clean, readable format.

### üå± Future Enhancements
- **Customer segmentation** using clustering to target promotions.
- **Mobile-friendly dashboards** for remote monitoring.
- **Real-time sync** between POS and Head Office even during network interruptions.
- **Deep learning** for even more accurate forecasting and advanced NLP sentiment classification.

This project shows how machine learning and thoughtful system design can transform traditional retail operations into a smart, data-driven experience.
